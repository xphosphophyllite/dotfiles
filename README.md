# dotfiles

Hey there! These are the dotfiles for my i3-Gaps setup. They aren't complete yet, so I wouldn't recommend using them as they are now, lest you want a broken desktop. You can still use parts of it as a reference to make your own setup. Make sure you have the following programs installed if you want it to work the way it does for me:

#### Dependencies
- [i3-Gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
- [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
- [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
- `compton`

And here a few extra things that aren't necessary, but are great to have:

#### Optional
- [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
- Icon glyph fonts
  - [Material Design Fonts](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont)
  - [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
  - [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
  - `gucharmap` : An excellent tool to help you find the font glyph you need; just go the the private use area of the font you want the glyph from (Make sure you set `View > By Unicode Block` and `Show only glyphs from this font`) and copy paste the icon you need (check the polybar wiki for more details).

The dotfiles are largely set to their defaults, ie. the i3 config is mostly the one provided by the community i3 build of Manjaro, and the polybar config is based off of the example config. There are still multiple lines and needless comments that need to be cleaned up, so I would not recommend using them at this point. Also, certain functionality is still missing, which I still need to implement scripts for (like selecting which wifi network to connect to).

_I will add screenshots soon._
